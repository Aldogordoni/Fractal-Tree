# Fractal-Tree
<h3>Fractal Tree drawing using p5.js</h3><br><br>
The code uses a recursive function branch() which draws 2 branches at different angles and with different stroke weight (lighter as the branch becomes smaller).<br>
It is possible to change the angle of each branch by using the slider underneath the tree (which goes from 0 to PI).
